3. Negotiate annual commits for 20-30% discounts
4. Implement tiered processing (more WASM, less cloud)

**100K Users Optimizations:**
1. Build own transcription infrastructure (save $30K/month)
2. Implement predictive clip generation
3. Use Phoenix distributed caching aggressively
4. Create regional Phoenix processing clusters

**1M Users Optimizations:**
